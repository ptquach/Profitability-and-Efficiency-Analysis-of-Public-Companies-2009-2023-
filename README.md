Profitability and Efficiency Analysis of Public Companies (2009–2023)

📌 Project Overview

- This project analyzes the profitability and efficiency of selected public companies over a 15-year period (2009–2023).

The analysis will show:

- Profitability rankings

- Leverage-to-profitability comparisons

- Multi-year performance trends for ROA, ROE, ROI and Net Profit Margins

- Inflation impact on profitability scores

🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data processing and statistical calculations

- Tableau for interactive dashboards and visual storytelling

- Data Sources: Profitability_Efficiency_Final.csv

📊 Key Features

- Profitability Score Ranking — Identifies top and bottom performers across the dataset

- Trend Analysis — Shows changes in profitability and efficiency metrics over time

- Leverage vs Profitability Scatterplot — Highlights which companies maintain high profits without excessive debt

- Macroeconomic Correlation Analysis — Measures how inflation relates to company profitability metrics

🔍 Insights & Takeaways

- Top Performers: Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) consistently outperform peers, driven by strong brand equity and efficient use of intangible assets.

- Leverage: Most companies operate in low-to-moderate debt ranges; negative debt/equity ratios are often linked with poor profitability.

- Macroeconomic Impact: Inflation rate shows minimal correlation with profitability metrics, suggesting internal strategies are more influential.
